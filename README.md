After completing two courses on deep learning (Deep Learning A-Z on Udemy and Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera), I found some interesting datasets on the internet and played with Keras to see what kind of accuracy I can achieve with simple neural networks / CNN / recurrent neural networks . This was all done when I was 16 :)

In The Deep Leearning Specialization I learned a lot about theory and it was very rewarding putting the theory into practice on my own, working on datasets I found most interesting.
  
Most of this was done during April/March 2022 and I have to admit, I have never had more fun in my life than those 2 months while I was learning about and developing AI.

I have also done many more CNN and RNN projects than the ones here, will upload them soon.
