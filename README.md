After completing two courses on deep learning (Deep Learning A-Z on Udemy and Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera), I found some interesting datasets on the internet and played with Keras to see what kind of accuracy I can achieve with just simple neural network. This was all done when I was 16 :)
