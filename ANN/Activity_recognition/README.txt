This is a neural network made in Keras which learnes to recognize 6 different motions base on watch accelerometer data with 80% accuracy.

The model is not very precise because it does not take into account time and only takes in current data into account.
A better model for this would be a Recurrent Neural Network, specifically with LSTM cells which would take into account time.
Nevertheless, a accuracy of 80% is suprising but would probably not work well in real life.

The data is not in the repository because it is 87 MB, but if you wish to have it feel free to contact me.
